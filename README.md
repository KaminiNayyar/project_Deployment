# Mini-project IV

### [Assignment](assignment.md)

## Project/Goals
The Goal of the project is to predict the loan approvals for different range of customers.

## Hypothesis
The assumption is to see if people (men or women) who are more educated or make more money have higher rate of getting approved or
people who are not graduated or make less money.

## EDA 
The goal behind the Exploratory Data analysis was to understand the data.

## Process
Firstly after understanding the data. I started cleaning, filled up with mean values for the numerics(int and float) and most common ( mode) for the object datatype. I used median for LoanAmount
Then ran some tests and analysed the data thoroughly with bar graphs and box plots.
For modelling I used Logistic Regression and also later tried to improve results by using grid search cv.
For Deployment created app.py and request.py test to deploy the model on browser.
And Then I deployed on Postman.

## Results/Demo
With Logistic regression the accuracy is at 0.88 and pipeline is performing at 0.83.
## Challanges 
Time was the biggest challenge in completion of the project.
## Future Goals
Time Management
